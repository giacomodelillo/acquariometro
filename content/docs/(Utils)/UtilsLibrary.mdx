## Format time

The `format_time` function retrieves the current local time and formats it into a string following the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format.

```python
formatted_time = format_time()
print(formatted_time)
```

---

## Convert to milliseconds

The `convert_milliseconds` function takes a single parameter, ms, which represents a duration in milliseconds. It converts this duration into days, hours, and seconds format and returns it as a string formatted as "days:hours:seconds".

```python
# Example 1: Convert 90065000 milliseconds to "days:hours:seconds" format
result = convert_milliseconds(90065000)
print(result)  # Output will be "1:1:5" (since 90065000 ms is approximately 1 day, 1 hour, and 5 seconds)
```

## Boot message

The `boot_messsage` function is designed to display a custom startup message and then pause the execution for 10 seconds before completing.

```python
from utils import boot_messsage
boot_messsage()
```

---

## Read config

The read_config function is designed to read and parse a JSON configuration file. It attempts to load the contents of the specified file into a dictionary, which it then returns. If an error occurs during this process (e.g., file not found or syntax errors in JSON), it logs the error using the provided logger handler `_LOGS_HANDLER`.

```python
# Assuming _LOGS_HANDLER is properly initialized and filename points to a valid JSON configuration file
config = read_config(_LOGS_HANDLER, "path/to/config.json")
if config:
    print(config)  # Print the contents of the configuration file
else:
    print("Failed to read configuration.")
```

**Error Handling and Logging**

- The function catches all exceptions that might occur during the execution (e.g., IOError, JSONDecodeError).
- If an error occurs, it logs a message using `_LOGS_HANDLER.log_append(1, f"Errore nella lettura della configurazione: {e}")` where e is the exception caught.
- The log entry indicates a critical error (level 1).
