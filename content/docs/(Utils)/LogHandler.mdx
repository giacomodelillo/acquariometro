## Summary

The `LogsHandler` class is designed to handle log entries with various levels of severity (INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR). It provides methods to append logs and retrieve them.

Example usage

```python
from utils import LogsHandler

logs_handler = LogsHandler()

logs_handler.log_append(1, "This is an info message.")
logs_handler.log_append(-2, "Critical error occurred!")

print(logs_handler.get_logs())
```

Appends a log entry to the internal logs array based on the provided status code and optional priority.

### Parameters

- `code`: An integer representing the severity of the log (1: INFO, 0: SUCCESS, -1: WARN, -2: ERROR)
- `message`: A string containing the log message
- `priority`: An optional integer (default is 0). If provided and non-zero, the log entry will be appended. If priority is zero or code is ERROR, the log entry will not be appended but printed to console.

## `get_logs`

Retrieves the logs from the internal array and formats a summary message based on the presence of ERROR logs.

**Returns** : A list representing the log entries, where the most recent status is at index 0.
