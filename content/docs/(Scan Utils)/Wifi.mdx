## Summary

The `WifiHandler` class is designed to handle Wi-Fi connection and scanning functionalities. It initializes with specific parameters such as a logger handler, RSSI range, SSID, password, and timeout settings. The class provides methods to connect to Wi-Fi and scan for available Wi-Fi networks.

**Usage**

```python
from scan_utils import WifiHandler
# Assuming you have instantiated a WifiHandler object named wifi_handler:
wifi_handler = WifiHandler(log_handler, wifi_rssi_range, wifi_ssid, wifi_password, wifi_timeout)

```

**Parameters**

- `log_handler`: An object that handles logging, used to report Wi-Fi connection status.
- `wifi_rssi_range`: A tuple defining the minimum and maximum RSSI values for a network to be considered in scans.
- `wifi_ssid`: The SSID (network name) of the Wi-Fi network.
- `wifi_password`: The password for the Wi-Fi network.
- `wifi_timeout`: The timeout duration (in seconds) for attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

## Methods

### `connect_to_wifi()`

Attempts to connect the device to a specified Wi-Fi network using provided SSID and password in `WifiHandler`.

### `scan_wifi()`

Performs BLE scanning and returns discovered devices. It retruns a list of dictionaries containing information about detected Bluetooth devices, each with keys rssi and mac_address.

```python
devices = wifi_handler.scan_wifi()
print(devices)

[
 {
     "id": device_bssid,
     "name": device_ssid,
     "rssi": rssi,
     "hidden": device_hidden,
     "channel": device_channel,
 },
 {...}
]
```
