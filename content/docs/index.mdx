## Welcome to the docs!

This project utilizes an ESP32 to detect unique devices in the area using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The system is designed to report data at regular intervals, pushing logs and device detection information to a centralized cloud database for real-time monitoring. The core functionality includes gathering data on device presence and unique identifiers and uploading this information for analysis on a single-page dashboard.
